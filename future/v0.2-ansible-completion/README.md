# v0.2.0 — FQCN completion + Jinja2 highlighting (on hold, paid tier)

**Business model (decided 2026-07-23):** v0.1.x (vault encrypt/decrypt)
stays free forever — it's the acquisition hook and the thing driving
Marketplace reviews. v0.2.0 (this folder) is the paid tier: "Ansible
Companion Pro". Suggested price $15-19 USD/year (well under the paid
incumbent's $59+/year), with a 30-day free trial handled automatically by
the IDE once the plugin is enrolled for Marketplace monetization (see
"What you still need to do" below).

## Why this isn't wrapping `ansible-language-server` anymore

The original plan (see git history: `future/v0.2-ansible-lsp/`, abandoned
2026-07-23) was to wrap Red Hat's `@ansible/ansible-language-server` via
LSP4IJ. That work — a full Node-runtime provisioner that downloads and
caches a checksum-verified Node binary per user, since bundling Node
itself for all 6 OS/arch combos would have meant a 500MB+ plugin — is
real and it worked (verified end-to-end against the real nodejs.org).

But tracing the language server's own source turned up a hard blocker:
`utils/misc.js`'s `getUnsupportedError()` does a bare
`process.platform === "win32"` check and tells the client "Ansible
Language Server can only run inside WSL on Windows." This isn't cosmetic
— confirmed by actually launching the bundled server with a real Node
binary and completing a real LSP `initialize` handshake: it responds fine
to the handshake, but its core value (FQCN completion, `ansible-lint`
diagnostics, config discovery) all shell out to real `ansible`,
`ansible-lint`, `ansible-config` binaries and even use the POSIX-only
`command -v` for tool detection (`services/ansibleConfig.js`,
`utils/getAnsibleMetaData.js`). None of that runs in native Windows
cmd/PowerShell, consistent with `ansible-core` itself failing to import
`fcntl` there (see `AnsibleVaultCipher`'s own doc comment).

Since this plugin's whole reason for existing is Windows users who need
IntelliJ/PyCharm specifically because Ansible doesn't run natively for
them, shipping a paid feature that silently doesn't work for most of that
audience was a non-starter. Pivoted to the same "reimplement, don't wrap
a tool that doesn't run where our users are" call already made for the
vault cipher: **static, bundled data + client-side logic, zero external
dependency.** The old `lsp/` and `runtime/` code was removed (still in
git history) rather than kept around unused.

## What's built here

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `completion/AnsibleModuleIndex.kt` | Loads a bundled JSON index of `ansible.builtin.*` module names + short descriptions. Data fetched once from the real `ansible/ansible` GitHub repo (the modules directory under `lib/ansible`, stable-2.17 branch, 69 modules with real descriptions after dropping 2 internal/deprecated ones) — see `resources/ansible_builtin_modules.json`. Hand-rolled minimal JSON parser (flat string map only) instead of a new dependency, same call as `AnsibleVaultCipher`/`ArchiveExtractor`. |
| `completion/AnsibleModuleCompletionContributor.kt` | A `CompletionContributor` scoped to `AnsibleYamlFileType` (from `detection/`, unchanged from the LSP attempt — still needed to avoid hijacking Kubernetes/Helm/Docker-compose YAML) **and** to YAML mapping-key positions specifically (`isCompletingYamlKey`, via `PsiTreeUtil`/`YAMLKeyValue`) so module names don't clutter completion while typing a value or comment. Not yet narrowed further to "top-level task key only" (see the class's own doc comment) — that needs live `runIde` verification to get right, not more guessing. |
| `completion/CheckLicense.kt` | JetBrains's own reference license-verification code (ported from `github.com/JetBrains/marketplace-makemecoffee-plugin`, `CheckLicense.java`, fetched and diffed byte-for-byte for the two embedded root certificates), gating the completion contributor. `PRODUCT_CODE` is the real value (`PANSIBLECOMPANI`) — see below. |
| `completion/JinjaExpressionDetector.kt` | Pure text scan for `{{ }}`/`{% %}`/`{# #}` Jinja2 regions inside a string, plus malformed-block detection (unterminated openers, stray closers) — addresses complaint #3. No real Jinja2 engine, no Python. Explicitly verified NOT to false-positive on YAML's own `{key: value}` flow-mapping syntax. |
| `completion/JinjaHighlightingAnnotator.kt` | A generic-`PsiElement`-based `Annotator` (deliberately avoids depending on YAML-specific PSI types — see its doc comment) that highlights `JinjaExpressionDetector`'s regions using `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE_COLOR`, gated behind the same license check with a 60s cache (`LicensingFacade` calls aren't free to make on every keystroke). |
| `completion-tests/AnsibleModuleIndexTest.kt` | 6 JUnit tests: JSON parsing (escapes, empty object, sorting), FQCN formatting, and a real load of the bundled resource asserting sane content (50-200 modules, `copy`/`debug`/`command` present, every entry non-blank). |
| `completion-tests/JinjaExpressionDetectorTest.kt` | 13 JUnit tests: all 3 region kinds, mixed/adjacent regions, empty expressions, unterminated/stray-closer malformed cases, and — the important one — confirming YAML's own `{...}`/`[...]` flow syntax is never mistaken for Jinja2 (that exact false positive is the incumbent's bug this feature is meant to avoid repeating). |

**Verified for real, not just written:** temporarily staged every file in
`completion/` and `detection/` into the live `src/main` (which already
has the real IntelliJ Platform SDK cached from earlier `verifyPlugin`
runs) — including a temporary `bundledPlugin("org.jetbrains.plugins.yaml")`
line in `build.gradle.kts`, since `AnsibleModuleCompletionContributor`
and `AnsibleYamlFileType` need it — and ran `./gradlew compileKotlin`.
Confirms `LicensingFacade`, `ActionUtil.performAction`,
`AnActionEvent.createEvent`, `Annotator`/`AnnotationHolder`/
`TextAttributesKey`/`DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors`, and
`YAMLKeyValue`/`PsiTreeUtil` are all called correctly against the actual
2025.2.6.2 + bundled-YAML-plugin classpath, not just plausible-looking
Kotlin. Also ran the real test suite (19/19 green across
`AnsibleModuleIndexTest` + `JinjaExpressionDetectorTest`). Reverted
`build.gradle.kts` and removed every temporary copy afterward — `git
diff build.gradle.kts` and `git status` both confirmed nothing leaked
into the live v0.1.x source set or build config.

**Bug caught during this verification, worth remembering:** Kotlin block
comments *nest* (unlike Java/C). A KDoc originally described the data
source as fetched from `` `lib/ansible/modules/*.py` `` — the `/*` inside
that path opened a *nested* comment that the KDoc's own closing `*/` never
reached, so the outer comment stayed open all the way to true EOF and
`compileKotlin` failed with "Unclosed comment" pointing at the last line
of the file, nowhere near the actual cause. This is the mirror image of
the previously-documented bug (a literal `*/` inside a comment closing it
early, e.g. `roles/*/tasks`) — same root cause (a path-like string
containing `/*` or `*/`), opposite mechanism (nesting-overflow instead of
early-close). Found it by bisecting the file with real `compileKotlin`
runs rather than eyeballing, since character-by-character reasoning about
where `/*`/`*/` pairs "should" match didn't account for nesting depth.
**Rule of thumb: never let a literal `/*` or `*/` substring — from a path,
a glob pattern, a code snippet — appear inside a Kotlin comment.**

## Marketplace monetization enrollment — applied, not yet approved (2026-07-23)

"Gap Hunter Labs" applied on the Monetization tab for the **FREEMIUM**
pricing model (the plugin itself stays free to install; only the v0.2
features go behind a license — as opposed to the plain "PAID" model,
which would paywall everything from install). JetBrains assigned the real
product code **`PANSIBLECOMPANI`** immediately, now in
`CheckLicense.PRODUCT_CODE` (was a placeholder before this) — but per
JetBrains's own text on that page, **"After applying for the Freemium or
Fully Paid pricing model, you will be contacted by our Support team"**,
so this isn't fully approved yet, just applied for.

JetBrains's own checklist for what's left (shown on that same page,
reproduced here so it doesn't get lost):

1. Inform users about the upcoming changes. (marketing, not code)
2. Obfuscate the plugin (optional — skip).
3. ~~Implement license verification calls.~~ **Done** — `CheckLicense.kt`.
4. ~~Create an organization and add banking information in the 'Vendor
   Information' tab.~~ **Done (2026-07-23)** — Trader Details filled in
   with banking info, document, etc. Still need to confirm plugin.xml's
   `<vendor>` ends up matching whatever `organization_id` this created
   (step 8 below) once that's visible on the Marketplace side.
5. Prepare the plugin on the Marketplace demo to test changes (optional).
6. Make changes in `plugin.xml` (see below — do this only when v0.2 ships).
7. Set the product descriptor's `code`, `release-date`, `release-version`,
   **and set `optional="true"`** — this is the attribute that actually
   marks the paid features as an add-on rather than making the whole
   plugin require a license, i.e. it's what makes FREEMIUM actually mean
   freemium instead of fully paid. Did not know about this attribute
   before reading JetBrains's own checklist; it changes the
   `<product-descriptor>` tag below.
8. ~~Check that plugin.xml's `<vendor>` matches the `organization_id`.~~
   **Checked (2026-07-23): they don't match yet.** The organization's ID
   is the URL slug `gap-hunter-labs` (from
   `plugins.jetbrains.com/vendor/gap-hunter-labs/edit/vendor`), lowercase
   and hyphenated. Live `plugin.xml` currently has
   `<vendor>Gap Hunter Labs</vendor>` — display-case, with a space. Do
   **not** change this in the live v0.1.x `plugin.xml` right now (same
   reasoning as the `<product-descriptor>` tag: changing vendor
   metadata while v0.1.0/0.1.1/0.1.2 are mid-moderation is an
   unnecessary risk to an unrelated, already-submitted change). Change
   it to `gap-hunter-labs` in the same batch of edits as adding
   `<product-descriptor>`, when v0.2 actually ships.
9. Set up pricing, offers, and coupons (this is where the actual
   $15-19/year price and 30-day trial get configured). **Confirmed
   2026-07-23: not available yet because both the plugin and the vendor
   account are still under review** (per JetBrains's own
   [Preparing your plugin for publication](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/prepare-your-plugin-for-publication.html)
   docs) — nothing to do here but wait.
10. Release the plugin.

## `<product-descriptor>` exact rules (learned 2026-07-23, corrects an earlier guess)

Read JetBrains's actual
[required-parameters](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/add-required-parameters.html)
and
[versioning](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/versioning-of-paid-plugins.html)
docs rather than guessing further:

- `code`: max 15 chars, must start with `P`, ALL CAPS, no digits/symbols.
  `PANSIBLECOMPANI` is exactly 15 chars and satisfies this — confirmed
  correct, not just assigned-and-hoped.
- `release-date`: `YYYYMMDD`.
- `release-version`: **not just an incrementing integer** — my earlier
  placeholder (`release-version="1"`) is invalid. Rules: at least 2
  digits; must strictly increase across releases (never descend); its
  first digits must align with the plugin's own `<version>` (JetBrains's
  own example: `<version>2021.1.1</version>` pairs with
  `release-version="20211"` — year+major concatenated, dots stripped).
  Our `<version>` is plain semver (`0.2.0`, not calendar-based), so the
  exact mapping isn't obvious from their examples — **decide this
  deliberately at reactivation time** (possibly by asking
  marketplace@jetbrains.com directly, since Support is already going to
  be in touch about the Freemium application) rather than guessing a
  value that could get the release rejected.
- `optional="true"`: required for FREEMIUM (see checklist item 7 above).

## What's still pending before reactivating this in `src/main`

Everything code-side is now built and compile-verified (FQCN completion,
scoped to key-position; Jinja2 highlighting; licensing). What's left is
mostly Marketplace-side and a few deliberate follow-ups:

1. Add `<product-descriptor code="PANSIBLECOMPANI" release-date="YYYYMMDD" release-version="TBD" optional="true"/>`
   to `plugin.xml` (see exact rules above for `release-version` — don't
   reuse the placeholder literally), **and** change `<vendor>` from
   `Gap Hunter Labs` to `gap-hunter-labs` in the same edit (checklist
   item 8, confirmed above). **Do not** make either change to the live
   v0.1.x `plugin.xml` before v0.2 actually ships in the same release.
2. Narrow the completion trigger further: right now it fires on any YAML
   key inside an Ansible-detected file, including nested module
   parameters (e.g. inside `copy:\n  <caret>`), not just top-level task
   keys. Needs live `runIde` verification to get the exact PSI shape
   right rather than guessing further untested.
3. Register `AnsibleModuleCompletionContributor` and
   `JinjaHighlightingAnnotator` in `plugin.xml`'s `<extensions>` (the
   latter with `language="yaml"` so the platform only invokes it for
   YAML files — see the annotator's own doc comment).
4. Move `detection/`, `completion/` back to `src/main/kotlin/...`, and
   `detection-tests/`, `completion-tests/` to `src/test/kotlin/...`.
   Restore `bundledPlugin("org.jetbrains.plugins.yaml")` in
   `build.gradle.kts` for real this time (not temporary).
5. Run the full `verifyPlugin` (6 IDEs) before publishing.
6. Manually verify Jinja2 highlighting and completion in a real `runIde`
   sandbox (typed, not just compiled) — neither has been exercised in an
   actual running editor yet, only compile-checked and unit-tested.

## To reactivate

1. Add `<product-descriptor>` and fix `<vendor>` in `plugin.xml` (step 1
   above).
2. Move the folders per step 4 above, restore the YAML dependency for
   real.
3. Register the extensions in `plugin.xml` (step 3 above).
4. `./gradlew test buildPlugin verifyPlugin`, then a manual `runIde` pass.
